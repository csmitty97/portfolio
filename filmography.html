    <h2 class="center">Short Films</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>"Unspoken"</h3>
    <iframe class="video" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12fk9zdUAK3yu9cXxempsRZswqeivwHHA/preview" width="45%" height="250px" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
    
    <p>Above is the trailer of my short film, Unspoken, which is a dark drama that touches on relationships, trauma and regret.  I learned a lot in the making of this film in regards to working on set with actors and being a leader
     for my crew.  Darius James plays the lead role of a lost young adult looking for answers in a broken relationship with his mother.</p>
    <p>In the Fall 2019, I took my first course in Mass Communication called "Mass Media and Society" where our final project was to make a short film.
     I chose to set high goals for myself and create a project that I would be proud to submit to a film festival. I developed my story idea at home, I wrote three
     drafts of a script and sent out casting notices to filming facebook groups.  I had the luck of bringing together a group of dedicated content creators, actors and actresses 
     that were interested in the story I wanted to portray. After two days and 18 hours of filming followed by several more hours of editing, I finally exported my first complete short film.
     My cast and crew all encouraged me to submit it to the Made in Arkansas film festival where it would ultimately be accepted and shown in front of an audience of other film makers 
     and film enthusiasts.    </p>
    <br>
   
    
    <h3>"Snatched"</h3>
    <img class="snatched" src="assets/img/snatched.jpg" alt="missing posters printing" ></img>
    <p>"Snatched" is another dark drama that tests the strength and loyalty of both a sibling relationship relationship and a romantic relationship.  The film stars Alivea Disney and Ashley Brewer with returning actor Darius White.</p>
    <p>My short film titled "Snatched" was the second project that I wrote, directed, produced and edited.  This project was for my Cinema Techniques course in the Fall 2020 at the University 
    of Arkansas at Little Rock.  This project brought new challenges that I didn't believe I would face so early. I was able to meet with very well known local actresses who were interested in my short film after
    speaking with me and hearing my intentions with the film and what I had to offer; credits with a goal to be accepted into yet another film festival. This project
    taught me how stressful being a producer can be; I felt like I was filling more of the producing role than I was the writing role or the directing role.  Working around everyones schedules, gathering everyone in the same place,
    and having to bring people back to reshoot some things. Ultimately, I learned a lot during this project about scheduling and setting expectations for all involved. I unfortunately did not get accepted into the film festival with this project but I am still proud of the obstacles I was able to overcome.
    </p>

    <h3>"Hidden Love"</h3>
    <img class="hiddenlove" src="assets/img/hiddenlove.jpg" alt="man and woman sitting on a bench looking distant"></img>
    <p>Hidden Love is a drama about the unlikely event of a long lost father and daughter meeting up again after a complicated past. They are both aware that the other is out there, however are unaware that they are looking for each other.</p>
    <p>This project is special because this short film was for my Capstone course in Mass Communication at the University in the Spring of 2021. This particular project was one of two for the semester; it was a group project where our classmates had the ability to choose each others roles for the short film.
    My peers along with my Professor, made the decision for me to be the Director of this Capstone Project based on the merit of my previous short films referencing my eye for detail in the script, new ideas for the script and my communication skills with crew and cast.
    I'm quite proud to have been chosen for this project as it shows the confidence my peers have in me and I was happy to be able to work with all of them.  Taking on the role of the director without being the writer or producer took a lot of pressure off me
    and allowed me to focus soley on how I wanted to tell the story through film shots and editing. This project was also submitted to several film festivals throughout Arkansas.  During my experience working with my peers, I asked how I could be a better director for the project
    and taking feedback.   </p>

    <h3>"The Spirit Finders"</h3>
    <iframe class="video" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QXZcB7gRBJAQXmIwfgBGgEdfd1mJMa1y/preview" width="45%" height="250px" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
   
    <p>The Spirit Finders was a comic/horror documentary that I created for my Documentary class at the University in the Spring of 2020. It follows the virtual paranormal investigative team called "The Spirit Finders" as they investigate a haunted prison. Narrator, Chris Gall, takes us through the adventures of the Spirit Finders as unfriendly spirits, scares and even death, await the Spirit Finders in this unforgiving prison.</p>
    <p>This documentary was the first documentary I worked on and my main goal was to make it fun and interesting. In a world where COVID is greatly affecting the film industry, I decided to try some experimental writing in my documentary course using video game gameplay with somewhat of a loose script. Adding the element of using video game gameplay and interviews within the prison with each team member during the investigation, I believe adds a hook for the viewers. I believed this medium for the documentary would be
    a creative way to work on my skills writing horror and comedy; both thought to be the most difficult genres to write. I spent a lot of time researching and learning effects to edit this documentary to match my vision as close as possible.  I consider this documentary a success in all of these aspects. </p>

    <h3>"Perspective"</h3>
    <iframe class="video" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aqmZIDmcMdiiWlz92yx7OqUhpvQV2fGI/preview" width="45%" height="250px" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
    <p>This documentary was my final project for my Documentary course at the University. This project follows a local well known aspiring producer, TJ McDaniel. He has spent most of his time since middle school/high school, working on producing beats for musical artists. 
    He has sold several beats and has experience in creating his own beats website.</p>
    <p>This documentary collects interviews and covers a history of TJ's interest in music, why he wants to be a music producer and how he believes he can build his brand.
    I used this project to strengthen my skills for a more formal documentary and I believe it to be a success in a structuring aspect. </p>
