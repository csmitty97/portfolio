    <p>"As the screenwriter and co-director as well as playing the main role in the film, I believe it's enough to consider him [Ricky Gervais] an auteur at least for this film.  Overall,
    taking into account Gervais’ style of films as part of the comedy genre, I would also qualify him as an auteur and The Invention of Lying as an auteurist film."</p>
    <p>The Invention of Lying is a fun comedy by Ricky Gervais that takes on 
    some deep concepts such as death and religion. This paper was for a course I took called "Movie Criticisms" where at the time, we were primarily going over the auteur theory.   An auteur is a filmmaker whose influence and artistic control is so high, that they are regarded as the author of the film.  I argued that Ricky Gervais falls under the title as he was a writer, director, producer, and played the lead role. This includes creative control over the rules of the new paradigm that Gervais creates for a world where lying doesn't exist.
    In this paper, I use the film "The Invention of Lying as an example to not only discuss the auteur theory 
    but also the ideas of idealism and class differences.  Idealism coming from the results of lying and the possible hidden meaning that Gervais is targeting by insinuating that class differences stem from lying.

    <h2>Example 2</h2>
    <h3 class="center">Nanny McPhee</h3>

    <p>"The Freudian Theory is quite applicable to this film as it states that events in our childhood influence and shape who we become as adults personality wise.  Using this theory of human behaviour, more specifically towards children, it is an understatement to say that that is what is going on in this film as Nanny McPhee is reshaping these children....Nanny McPhee is a very simple yet effective choice for film topics such as ideologies and representations when it comes to human behaviour and its influencers as well as wealth class differences. "</p>
    <p>Another paper written for "Movie Criticisms" was an analysis of the 2005 fiction film, Nanny McPhee to discuss themes addressed in the film such as ideologies, societal and economic differences as well as the Freudian Theory.
    The Freudian Theory in this instance refers to the idea that events in our childhood influence and shape our personality when we become adults. This paper requires a discussion over social, economic, class representation and psychological issues, all of which are covered in the film.  I used these issues to discuss hidden meanings in the film, most referring to the emotional/mental changes of the children and the physical changes to Nanny McPhee throughout the film.
