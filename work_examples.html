    <p>"As the screenwriter and co-director as well as playing the main role in the film, I believe it's enough to consider him [Ricky Gervais] an auteur at least for this film.  Overall,
    taking into account Gervais’ style of films as part of the comedy genre, I would also qualify him as an auteur and The Invention of Lying as an auteurist film."</p>
    
    <p>This paper was for a course I took called "Movie Criticisms" where at the time, we were primarily going over the auteur theory.  
    In this paper, I use the film "The Invention of Lying as an example to not only discuss the auteur theory 
    but also the ideas of idealism and class differences.  An auteur is a filmmaker whose influence and artistic control is so high, that they are regarded as the author of the film.
    The Invention of Lying is a fun comedy by Ricky Gervais that takes on 
    some deep concepts such as death and religion, however, I used all the roles that Gervais plays in the creation of the film to demonstrate
    how I consider him to be an auteur director.</p>
