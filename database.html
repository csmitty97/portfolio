    <h2>Example 1</h2>

    <h3 class="center">Music Sales</h3>
    <img class="music" src="assets/img/music.png" alt=""></img>
    <p>You can view this spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gr-lb4MSZRIkU2Ooq6rcbzbC00TlrKmlSyLBLsU-Ulc/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
    <p>This spreadsheet lists 25 different types of music genres with number of sales for each, dollar amounts for each and a ranking system. The purpose of this spreadsheet is to use a database to choose a start invoice date and an ending invoice date to determine how many units were sold and how much in sales was made. Database information is plugged into other spreadsheets and then those spreadsheets are plugged into one main sheet where everything is calculated. When the dates are plugged in, the ranking system highlights the top three genres in dollar amounts in a light green.
    Taking the time to learn the formula has opened doors to new organizational strategies as wll as leadership strategies. </p>

    <h2>Example 2</h2>
    <h3 class="center">Enrollment Projections</h3>
    <img class="schools" src="assets/img/schools.png" alt=""></img>
    
    <p>You can view this spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZRsKX5Sajv_qRRqH4i5UvtqcuWR7BCPefcZnOs3gfM/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
    <p>Using data from elementary, middle and high schools, we try to project how much of an enrollment increase each school obtains. We use past data to give us an idea to how much of an increase we are seeing in enrollment in each of these school every year. Every elementary school, every middle school, every high school has calculated data that corresponds with the percent of projected increase for every year. A chart is even presented to us to show us a visual of the increase every year for each school. The fourth spreadsheet shows the total increase over all five years ranging from 2016-2020 of all the students for all three categories of schools.</p>
