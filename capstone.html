    <p>My first thought after finishing the Capstone project is that there are some things I would definitely like to work on such as my aptitude in wordpress.
    I spent a great deal of my time working on wordpress, trying to figure out something new almost every time. I would also work on my communication skills with my team as I feel our overall communication could've been better.
    I discovered that I'm really more interested in coding than I am in web design which prompted me to start looking for programs to help me strengthen my skills in backend coding. Some of the most challenging moments were wanting to get a start on the paypal and the merch but not having much help from our client to get information we needed. 
    Ultimately, we stemmed away from paypal and geared everything towards the central Arkansas tickets website. I feel like our solution is relatable as it shows that problems like these occur when dealing with clients all the time and we just need to be creative and/or have a backup plan. Overall, I would say that my lack of wordpress knowledge got in my way as I had to relearn everything as we were developing the site.</p>
   <p>Overall, I feel like the team could have communicated better, especially on my end as I showed up via virtual classroom during most of the classes this semester. I did try to stay connected with the team through discord and email but it's not the same as a face to face interaction. There's only so much a connection we can build with each other there. My teammates helped me by being patient and answering a lot of questions about wordpress as I was relearning. I feel like my biggest asset was my creativeness or my ability to bounce ideas. Overall, I believe my tasks were completed to the best of my ability. I learned what I needed to learn and I worked on what I thought would best help the team and not mess up what they were working on in the process. I think I could have branched out a little more to take on more responsibility and learn more about wordpress. If I was to approach a project like this again, I would be more open with my team leader and be more self motivated to exploring Wordpress more. 
   The moments I was most proud of was completing the YOAST SEO requirements that we were able to complete for every page.  I also felt proud when adding in all the scheduled future events with pictures from the old site.</p>
   <p>There are several different things that could've made this project easier for our team. However, I'm not sure I could teach this problem-solving process easily simple because it takes critical thinking and creativity and I'm confident in my ability to teach that. I would like to improve my tendency to be complacent. I get comfortable with what I know and I don't want to learn or take the time to learn. That's how I can better support my teammates; by finding more self motivation and determination to take on more responsibility. </p>
