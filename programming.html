    <h1>Programming Examples</h1>
    
    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <h3 class="center">Unit Conversion</h3>
    <img class="spacebear" src="assets/img/units.png" alt=""></img>
    <p>You can visit the site and use the unit converter by clicking <a href="https://csmitty97.github.io/it-amethyst/unit_converter/index.html">here!</a></p>
    <p>The Unit Conversion program was a lot of fun to work on to me simply because I enjoy coding.  The assignments being AJAX assignments made it fun as I got to code the design as well as the program. When it comes to Javascript Programs, I always started with the front-end development to get the look of the program down before starting the program aspect. A main issue I had when working on this was getting the same number returned that I used for my input.
     All that told me was that the program wasn't working and so I had to learn to inspect the site and debug it to see exactly where the problem was occurring. The problem stemmed from my not having linked the unit conversion file from my Professors site so the program could know what a mile was, a centimeter, an inch, etc. Once I plugged this in, I had little to know problem working out the rest of the tweaks on the program.</p>

    <h2>Example 2</h2>
    <h3 class="center">Forex Currency History</h3>
    <img class="currency" src="assets/img/forex.png" alt=""></img>
    <p>You can visit the site and use the currency value history program <a href="https://csmitty97.github.io/it-amethyst/forex/index.html">here!</a></p>
    <p>I was looking forward to learning API's the most in my Guided Apps and I.T. course. This program is simply a currency conversion for specified dates with a graph included in the results so the fluctuation can be visible. The results would show a table of the date and what the price was to convert the currency with the chart below. The part that tripped me up when working on this program 
    was adding the variables I had created in the beginning, to the API so the program could read the API as one line of code before executing myMethod. </p>
