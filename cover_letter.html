    <h1>Letter of Introduction</h1>
    <p2>Dear Sir/Ma'am,</p2>
    <p>I am interested in a position with your company. At your convenience, I'd like the chance to discuss any opportunities that may be available. 
    You can find my resume attached.</p>
    <p>As a content producer, having received a Bachelors of Arts in Mass Communication with a minor in I.T., I am writing to express interest in a position with your company. 
    I believe my current knowledge and skill set align with what you are looking for in this position.  Before attending college, I took it upon myself to learn video creating 
    and editing.  I taught myself adobe premiere and photoshop and relating to I.T., I taught myself the basics of Python, HTML and CSS. Attending the University of Arkansas has 
    only strengthened my skills as well as gaining new ones such as Javascript and SQL. I decided to take computer science courses as well as gaining a minor in I.T. to compliment 
    my creative skills.  I am also currently looking at programs to strengthen my knowledge and skills in back-end development; Javascript, Java, C#, SQL etc. I like to say that my degree in Mass Communication taught me how to be more creative and I think that is something I can bring over to your company. Bottom line, 
    I have a passion for creating.</p>
    <p>Combined with four years of customer service experience, writing and directing several short films, teaching myself several creative skills, I believe I have shown self discipline, motivation, leadership and the project 
    management skills that allow me to stand out.  Taking into account my experience, I believe I excel at:
    <ul>
        <li>Project Management</li>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Front-End Development</li>
        <li>Problem Solving</li>
        <li>Client Interaction</li>
        <li>Any Filmmaking/Editing Job</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Please review my attached resume for details regarding my knowledge and skill set. Do not hesitate to reach out if there are any questions.  My number is (501)554-0996.  I am interested to meet with you
     and discuss available positions further.</p>
     <p>Thank you for your consideration,</p>
     
     <p2>Caleb Smith<br>4 Ridgewood Dr.<br>Sherwood, AR 72120<br>(501)554-0996<br>c.smith997@hotmail.com</p2>
