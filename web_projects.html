    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <h3 class="center">Space Bear</h3>
    <img class="spacebear" src="assets/img/spacebear.jpg" alt="bear yelling out while standing on mars next to the Mars Rover"></img>
    
    <p>This space bear picture was the first assignment we had when learning gravit which is an illistrator/graphic designer platform. We needed to take a picture of a bear in the woods and make it look like it is in space with dimensions.
     Starting by cutting out the bear from its' image and then moving that mask to the front so the bear is appearing in front of the space background photo. After that, the next task is to work on the bears dimensions. This is where the shadows and its' angles are used; interpreting where light is coming from and designing its shadow on the opposite side.  I also had to take distance into consideration to determine how big to make the shadow. 
     The shadow was the most difficult part because I had to figure out the most realistic direction and angle to place and elongate the bears' shadow.
     I had little to no experience in graphic design so Gravit took a bit of time to learn, however, it is a useful tool for anyone looking for an alternative to Adobe Illistrator. </p>

    <h2>Example 2</h2>
    <h3 class="center">Gravit CoStar Logo</h3>
    <img class="starco" src="assets/img/gravit.png" alt=""></img>
  
    <p>I learned more when working on this Gravit assignment just because of the fact that there are many layers to making recreating this logo.  It was a step by step tutorial that we had to recreate and even recreating was time consuming just because I wanted it to look exactly right.
    Figuring out the correct colors without hex numbers as well as figuring out the distance between each other them was a difficult task. The problem that gave me the most trouble though was sending the start to the front so that the colors would swirl and disappear behind the star. I somehow added the shadow inside the middle between I actually moved the star to the front.
    Working with gravit showed the same fundamentals needed for using Illistrator.  Although I believe Gravit has just a few less tools, it has a free version that allows you to work on your own projects with basic access. </p>
