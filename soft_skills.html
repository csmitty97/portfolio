    <h1>Soft Skills Examples</h1>
    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    
    <h3 class="center">Myers Briggs</h3>
    <img class="intj" src="assets/img/intj.jpg" alt=""></img>
    
    <p>One of the first soft skills assignments we received in our first I.T. course was completing the Myers Briggs personality test. We were broken up into groups and had to discuss what our results meant and how they reflected us.
     My results were that I am an INTJ-T personality type which means "Introverted - Intuitive - Thinking - Judging - Turbulent". This says that I'm introverted and am an extremely logical and rational thinker.  Emotions don't play as strong a role when making decisions and I can lack empathy.
      I believe in reason and explanations with the need to question everything. I believed my results matched me pretty well because I would rather work from home and I do believe most decisions should not be compromised by emotions or else more risks might be involved. I always need to be right and I am stubborn about that fact.</p>

    <h2>Example 2</h2>
    
  <h3 class="center">Power Searching with Google Course</h3>
    <p>In this activity, we watched videos on operating the google search engine and had to discuss five things that we took away from the course. I learned
    many things from this course regarding searching images as well as narrowing down searches. Also learning ways to search files with specific words or phrases with more precise results as well narrowing down the file types I am seeking.
    The google search engine courses were long but I believe it was helpful in learning the engine and in reflection writing afterwards. I have since used what I've learned regularly when making more specific searches and it has helped tremendously. I had always wondered about searching by using an image, however, never knew there was an actual way to execute such a search.</p>
