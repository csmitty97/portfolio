<h1>Elevator Pitch</h1>
<p>My goal is to reach new heights in life, mostly on a personal level, when it comes to creating. 
I went from being a story writer to being a script writer to evolving into a film director while learning new skills in web development. 
I believe my skills go hand in hand and can be a great asset in many different companies or even freelance work. Iâ€™m determined, creative and 
open to all ideas when it comes to my work and I think that makes me a valuable team player. </p>
